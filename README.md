# Makersharks Supplier Search API
This project is a proof of concept (POC) for a RESTful API that allows users to search for manufacturers (suppliers) based on specific criteria such as location, 
nature of business, and manufacturing processes. The API is built using Spring Boot and includes features like pagination, input validation, and structured response handling.
